      <h1>Popularly known as <em>"SIMON GAME"</em></h1>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li>Simon is named after the simple children's game of Simon Says.</li>
        <li>The game contains four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is clicked or activated by the system.</li>
        <li>A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one button in each level, after which the player must reproduce the order of buttons from the very starting of the game by clicking the buttons.</li>
        <li>As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.</li>
        <li>Level is incremented each time the user is able to reproduce the correct sequence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why it's named BRAIN GAME ?</h2>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li>The game indirectly tests the memorising power of user's brain.</li>
        <li>How well the user is at remembering the sequences or pattern?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What you can do?</h2>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li>If you feel that this game can sharpen your brain or can make impact on your brain in positive manner</li>
        <li>Then you should recommend it to children of age less than 10yrs so that they can benefit from it in their early childhood.</li>
